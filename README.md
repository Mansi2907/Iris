**Iris Dataset Classification**

During my analysis of the Iris dataset, I performed linear regression to predict one of the continuous features by building four regression models with different permutations of input features. 
This involved using combinations of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width to create predictive models, which were then evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) to determine their accuracy and effectiveness.
Additionally, I carried out classification tasks using logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to classify the iris species. 
For logistic regression, I trained the model to distinguish between setosa, versicolor, and virginica species based on the four features and evaluated its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix.
With LDA, I focused on dimensionality reduction to enhance class separation before training the classifier, ensuring a robust model capable of accurately predicting the species of iris flowers.
